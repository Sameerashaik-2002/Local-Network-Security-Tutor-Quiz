# Network Security Basics
Network security protects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and services. Core controls include authentication, authorization, accounting, segmentation, encryption, monitoring, and incident response. The CIA triad guides design decisions. Threats include malware, phishing, man-in-the-middle, denial of service, and misconfiguration.
