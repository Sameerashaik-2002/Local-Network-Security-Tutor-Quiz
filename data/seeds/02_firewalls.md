# Firewalls
A firewall enforces a security policy by filtering traffic between networks. Common types include packet-filtering, stateful inspection, application-layer (proxy), and next-generation firewalls with IDS/IPS features. Best practice includes default-deny rules, least privilege, logging, and change control with documented rule reviews.
