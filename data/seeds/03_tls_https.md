# TLS and HTTPS
Transport Layer Security (TLS) provides confidentiality and integrity for data in transit. The TLS handshake authenticates the server and agrees on session keys. HTTPS is HTTP over TLS. Strong cipher suites, HSTS, certificate pinning, and proper certificate management reduce downgrade and MITM risks.
